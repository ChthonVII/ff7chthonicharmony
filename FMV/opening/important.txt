Different font engines produce radically different results from the sane input.

These files were made so that my copy of vapoursynth-subtext produces something pretty similar to the original SAC files. (Within a few pixels.)

So far as I know, vapoursynth-subtext is using my local libav, which is 7:7.1.2-0+deb13u1.
