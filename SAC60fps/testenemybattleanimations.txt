For Test series enemies' battle animations, just duplicate and rename files from the 60FPS mod as follows:

Test 0 (aa) < Guard Hound (ar)
Test 1 (ab) < Grunt (at)
Test 2 (ac) < Deenglow (br)
Test 3 doesn't exist in JORG
Test 4 (ae) < Hedgehog Pie (bc)
Test 5 (af) < Serpent (ki)
Test 6 (ag) < Adamantaimai (gq)
Test 7 (ah) < Grosspanzer Big (lf)
Test 8 (ai) < Grosspanzer Small (lg)
Test 9 (aj) < Grosspanzer Mobile (lh)

Guard Hound (ar) and Grunt (at) have ninostyle battle models,
so we can duplicate and rename the model files to reuse them for Test 0 and Test 1.
(The animation file from 60 FPS should override the animation file from Ninostyle Battle when both are active.)
